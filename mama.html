    <h1>Mama Cat Kidnaps Baby Bunnies</h1>
    <p>One afternoon, she came through her basement cat door carefully carrying a very tiny baby bunny by the scruff of its neck. I happened to see her and took it away unharmed, putting it in a box lined with a soft cloth until I could figure out what to do with it. Meanwhile, she went outdoors again and in a few minutes was back with another baby bunny. She brought back four of the babies before deciding that was enough. Then she climbed into the box next to them and started grooming them and purring, turning on her side trying to entice them to nurse. Unfortunately, she no longer had milk to feed them.</p>
